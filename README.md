Groodle is an application that takes the courses that a graduate student in Computer Science at UNO has already taken as input,
and determines which courses that student must still take in order to graduate.  The back-end of Groodle was built with
the Spring Framework.

In order to run the back-end, locate GroodleServerApplication.java, right-click on it, and then "Run."
